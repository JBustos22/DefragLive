# DFTwitchBot
An interface between Twitch chat and DeFRaG.

## Todo List
- [x] Added announcer sounds with commands
- [x] Check if commands such as (called a vote) are from players or server. (Finished, but not guaranteed )
- [ ] On connect, PM each nospec player a reminder that they have nospec on. Use /tell client id msg
- [x] Refactor bot.py to remove the 'elif' galore
- [ ] Integrate forever-free API for ?stonks. Yahoo api is good but only 500 /mo hits free. Look at coingecko for crypto
