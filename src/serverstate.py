"""
This file contains two important classes that contain the current live state of the game:
State - stores information about the current server, such meta data and players. It contains a set of methods to
         conveniently query information that is expected to be needed frequently.
Player - stores individual in-depth information about each player. The server object's players attribute contains a
         list of these objects

It also contains many important methods that handle different parts of the server state process. See their documentation
for details.
